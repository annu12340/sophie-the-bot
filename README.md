## Built With
  
  * Python

## Libraries Used

  * urllib.request

    basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.

  * bs4 (Beautiful Soup)
  
    [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, 
    providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

  * csv (Comma Separated Values)
  
    [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)The csv module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. It allows programmers to say, “write this 
    data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel. 
    Programmers can also describe the CSV formats understood by other applications or define their own special-purpose CSV formats.
    
  * nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
    The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python package for natural language processing. NLTK requires Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8.
